0.2 (UNRELEASED)
----------------
Improvements:
 - --output does not overwrite already existing files.
 - Some code cleanup and robustification, thanks Yann Droneaud!
 - Proper handling of Control-C (SIGINT), thanks Yann Droneaud!
 - When specifying --timestamp twice, print time as seconds since epoch, which
   is easier for automatic post-processing.

Bug fixes:
 - Listen to "close" events as well.
 - Simplify and robustify determination of path names. This also fixes the
   races which led to many events being shown with device/inode only.
